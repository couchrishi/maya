Product Requirements Document: Maya Game Studio
Executive Summary
Maya Game Studio is an AI-powered game creation platform featuring a unified, high-performance agent. The platform enables users to create browser-based games through natural language, demonstrating how a single, powerful agent can manage a complex, multi-stage creative process. This monolithic architecture is optimized for minimal latency, making it ideal for live demonstrations.

Product Overview
Vision
To demonstrate a powerful, unified AI agent capable of handling a complex creative workflow—from code generation to quality assurance and enhancement—to transform ideas into playable games in under 10 seconds.

Demo Objectives
Showcase a streamlined, low-latency game generation process.

Illustrate how a single agent can perform a multi-stage task (build, test, polish) sequentially.

Deliver working games with high-quality code and polished features.

Maintain exceptionally fast response times suitable for live, interactive demonstrations.

Unified Agent Architecture
Single-Agent Design
The system is built around a single, multi-talented agent that internalizes the entire game creation workflow. This eliminates the communication and orchestration overhead inherent in multi-agent systems, ensuring maximum speed.

Internal Workflow Pattern
The agent follows a deterministic, sequential workflow for each request:

Drafting Phase: The agent generates the initial, functional game code based on the user's request.

Refinement Phase: The agent immediately runs its internal QA and enhancement subroutines on the drafted code. It checks for bugs, validates logic, and identifies opportunities for polish.

Integration Phase: The agent applies all necessary fixes and enhancements, resolving any internal conflicts based on predefined priorities (e.g., bug fixes over visual effects).

Delivery: The final, polished code is presented to the user.

This pattern optimizes for speed by removing all network latency and synchronization delays between separate components.

Maya Agent Specification
Purpose
To serve as a self-contained, end-to-end game generator, handling all aspects of creation from ideation to final polish.

Core Capabilities
Natural Language Understanding: Interprets complex game requirements from user prompts.

Full-Stack Generation: Creates complete HTML/CSS/JavaScript game code.

Integrated Quality Assurance: Performs static code analysis, logic validation, and bug detection.

Automated Enhancement: Adds "game juice" like particle effects, screen shake, and improved audio-visual feedback.

Self-Correction: Iteratively improves code by merging feedback from its internal QA and enhancement modules.

Communication Protocol
The agent uses a simple input/output model.
Input:

JSON

{
  "requirements": "string",
  "context?": "GameContext"
}
Output:

JSON

{
  "code": "GameCode",
  "explanation": "string",
  "metadata": {
    "gameType": "string",
    "features": ["string"],
    "qualityScore": "number"
  }
}
Generation Workflow
Phase 1: Requirement Analysis (1 second)

Agent receives user input and parses the game requirements.

Initializes the generation context.

Phase 2: Draft Generation (3-4 seconds)

Agent generates the complete, baseline game code.

Phase 3: Internal Review & Refinement (3-4 seconds)

Agent executes its QA subroutine to identify and flag bugs.

Simultaneously, it runs its enhancement subroutine to generate code for polish and game feel.

The agent integrates fixes and enhancements, prioritizing stability.

Phase 4: Finalization & Delivery (1 second)

Agent compiles the final game version.

The game is published to the preview window with a summary of changes.

User Experience
Interface Architecture
The UI is updated to reflect the single-agent process, replacing the multi-agent monitor with a single status tracker.

Maya Assistant Personality
Core Traits: Knowledgeable, Encouraging, Transparent, Educational.

Communication Examples:

Initial: "Hello! I'm Maya. Tell me your game idea, and I'll build it, test it, and polish it for you. What would you like to create?"

During Building: "Great idea! I'm building the core mechanics now. After that, I'll run my internal checks to fix any bugs and add some extra polish. You can follow my progress right here."

Completion: "Your game is ready! I generated the code, fixed 3 potential bugs, and added particle effects for more impact. Try it out!"

Technical Implementation
Monolithic Agent Design
The system is built as a single, powerful service. This approach offers several advantages for this use case:

Reduced Complexity: No need for complex orchestration frameworks, message queues, or state synchronization.

Lower Latency: Eliminates network overhead and serialization/deserialization costs between agents.

Deterministic Execution: The sequential process is predictable and easier to debug.

Performance Optimization
Response Time Targets:

Phase 1 (Analysis): < 1 second

Phase 2 (Build): < 4 seconds

Phase 3 (Refine): < 4 seconds

Phase 4 (Finalize): < 1 second

Total: < 10 seconds

Optimization Strategies:

Agent Warm-up: The agent model is pre-loaded and ready to accept requests.

Template Caching: Common game patterns and code structures are cached.

Efficient Subroutines: The internal QA and enhancement logic is optimized for speed.

(The sections on Game Generation Capabilities, Demo Scenarios, Success Metrics, Implementation Roadmap, and Risk Mitigation remain largely the same, with minor text adjustments to reflect the single-agent model.)
