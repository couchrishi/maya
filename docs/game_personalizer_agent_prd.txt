Game Personalizer Agent - Product Requirements Document
Asset Generation & Visual Customization Specialist
1. Product Overview
Vision
A specialized agent that handles all asset generation, visual customization, and upload-based personalization for HTML5 games, while the Game Creator Agent continues handling game mechanics and basic modifications.
Problem Statement

Users want custom visual assets that don't exist in standard game generation
Photo uploads need intelligent processing to become game-compatible assets
AI-generated assets require specialized prompting and quality control
Visual modifications need different expertise than game logic modifications

Solution
A Game Personalizer Agent focused exclusively on creating, modifying, and integrating visual assets, working in parallel with the existing Game Creator Agent.
