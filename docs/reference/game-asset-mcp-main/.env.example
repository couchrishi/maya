# Hugging Face Authentication Credentials
# Rename this file to .env and fill in your credentials

# Hugging Face API Token (REQUIRED)
# This token is required for accessing the Hugging Face Inference API and Spaces

# 3D Model Generation Space (REQUIRED)
# You must choose and duplicate ONE of the following spaces to your Hugging Face account:
#
# Option 1: InstantMesh Space
# Duplicate from: https://huggingface.co/spaces/mubarak-alketbi/InstantMesh
# Example value: your-username/InstantMesh
#
# Option 2: Hunyuan3D-2 Space
# Duplicate from: https://huggingface.co/spaces/mubarak-alketbi/Hunyuan3D-2
# Example value: your-username/Hunyuan3D-2
#
# Option 3: Hunyuan3D-2mini-Turbo Space
# Duplicate from: https://huggingface.co/spaces/mubarak-alketbi/Hunyuan3D-2mini-Turbo
# Example value: your-username/Hunyuan3D-2mini-Turbo
#
# IMPORTANT: Duplicating a space to your own account allows you to:
# 1. Avoid GPU quota limitations that affect shared spaces
# 2. Have dedicated resources for your 3D model generation
# 3. Control access and privacy settings
#
# Format must be "username/space-name" (e.g., "your-username/InstantMesh")
# After duplicating, your space URL will be: https://huggingface.co/spaces/your-username/SpaceName
# But you should only enter "your-username/SpaceName" in this variable
#
# NOTE: The application will automatically detect which space you've duplicated
# based on the endpoints available in the space.
MODEL_SPACE=your-username/InstantMesh

# 3D Model Generation Configuration
# These settings control how 3D models are generated.
# If not specified, the defaults values will be used.

# Number of inference steps for 3D model generation
# Higher values produce better quality but take longer
# InstantMesh: 75 (default)
# Hunyuan3D-2: 20-50 (default: 20)
# Hunyuan3D-2mini-Turbo: 1-100 (default: 5 for Turbo mode)
MODEL_3D_STEPS=

# Guidance scale for 3D model generation
# Controls how closely the model follows the prompt
# InstantMesh: N/A
# Hunyuan3D-2: 0.0-100.0 (default: 5.5)
# Hunyuan3D-2mini-Turbo: 0.0-100.0 (default: 5.0)
MODEL_3D_GUIDANCE_SCALE=

# Octree resolution for 3D model generation
# Controls the detail level of the 3D model
# InstantMesh: N/A
# Hunyuan3D-2: "256" or "512" (default: "256")
# Hunyuan3D-2mini-Turbo: 16-512 (default: 256)
MODEL_3D_OCTREE_RESOLUTION=

# Seed value for 3D model generation
# Controls the randomness of the generation process
# InstantMesh: Default is 42

# Optional: Manually specify the space type to override automatic detection
# Valid values: "instantmesh", "hunyuan3d", "hunyuan3d_mini_turbo"
# Use this if automatic space type detection fails
